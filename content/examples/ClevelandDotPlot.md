You could create this kind of plot by reshaping your data into rows of containing `name`, `value` and `group` and plot it kind of like a scatter plot. But here's another way that keeps the data in its current form and takes advantage of Layer Cake's accessor shorthand. In `main.js`, we simply specify the names of the keys in each row that we want to plot and in the layer component, we call `$xGet(row)` and it maps our row into an array of pixel values.
